NeuroPyâ„¢ Core Security Libraries
NeuroPyâ„¢ integrates advanced security modules to ensure safe, ethical, and robust AI operations. These libraries provide secure cognitive computing capabilities, protecting neural models from adversarial attacks, unauthorized access, and data tampering. Below is a structured list of NeuroPyâ„¢ Core Security Libraries:

1. neuro.security.auth
ðŸ”¹ Authentication & Access Control

Implements multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AI models.
Supports role-based access control (RBAC) for secured API calls.
Provides biometric authentication integration (face, fingerprint, voice).
ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
from neuro.security.auth import RBAC

rbac = RBAC()
rbac.create_role("admin", permissions=["read", "write", "execute"])
rbac.assign_role("user123", "admin")
2. neuro.security.encryption
ðŸ”¹ Secure Data Encryption & Hashing

Supports AES-256, RSA, and ECC encryption for AI model weights.
Implements homomorphic encryption for secure model inference.
Provides hashing algorithms (SHA-256, BLAKE2) for data integrity.
ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
from neuro.security.encryption import AES256

aes = AES256(key="mysecurekey")
encrypted_data = aes.encrypt("Sensitive Information")
decrypted_data = aes.decrypt(encrypted_data)
3. neuro.security.adversarial
ðŸ”¹ Adversarial Attack Detection & Defense

Detects adversarial perturbations in neural networks.
Implements gradient masking & adversarial training.
Provides input validation against evasion attacks.
ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
from neuro.security.adversarial import AdversarialDefense

defender = AdversarialDefense()
is_safe = defender.detect_attack(input_data)
4. neuro.security.privacy
ðŸ”¹ Privacy-Preserving AI & Differential Privacy

Implements differential privacy to prevent sensitive data leaks.
Supports federated learning for decentralized model training.
Provides zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) authentication.
ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
from neuro.security.privacy import DifferentialPrivacy

dp = DifferentialPrivacy(epsilon=0.5)
private_data = dp.apply_noise(sensitive_data)
5. neuro.security.monitoring

Provides behavior anomaly detection for AI decision-making.
Integrates with SIEM tools (Splunk, AWS CloudWatch, Azure Sentinel).
Supports audit logging and compliance tracking.
ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:

python
Copy
Edit
from neuro.security.monitoring import AIThreatMonitor

monitor = AIThreatMonitor()
monitor.log_event("Unusual model behavior detected")
6. neuro.security.network
ðŸ”¹ Secure AI Model Communications & API Protection

Implements SSL/TLS encryption for API calls.
Detects DDoS and MITM attacks in AI model communication.
Provides firewall rules for AI model access control.
ðŸ“Œ Example Usage:

python
